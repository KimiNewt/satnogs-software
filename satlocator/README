# Satlocator

A framework for tracking satellites from specified observation points.

## Components

The framework consists of a number of modules, providing modular, self-contained functionality in the following fields:

- TLE retrieval from the SpaceTrack service API
- Orbital object trajectory calculations
- Administration API
- Data storage backend (initially implemented in sqlite, but anyone can implement their own based on preference/requirements)
- Tracking manipulation API
- Socket communication with remote (or local) hardware

# Admin API

## Run

System dependencies (optional, provides gevent workers to gunicorn):

`apt-get install gevent` 

System dependencies (optional, APIs can be powered by bottle alone):

`apt-get install gunicorn` 

Python dependencies (that can be installed inside a virtualenv):

`pip install bottle`
`pip install pyephem`
`pip install sqlite3`
`pip install requests`

and it's accessible through a dead simple web api:

`gunicorn --workers 2 -b 127.0.0.1:8001 --log-level INFO tracker_admin_api:app`

More complicated (though probably preferable) invocations of gunicorn are provided within the file header.

Alternatively, it can be called simply via python:

`python tracker_admin_api.py`

example functionality provided:

`http://localhost:8001/observer/add/`


Also, 

`http://localhost:8001/observer/add/`

should provide a web interface for easier usage of the API.

# Tracker Worker API

## Run

System dependencies (optional, provides gevent workers to gunicorn):

`apt-get install gevent` 

System dependencies (optional, APIs can be powered by bottle alone):

`apt-get install gunicorn` 

Python dependencies (that can be installed inside a virtualenv):

`pip install bottle`

and it's accessible through a dead simple web api:

`gunicorn --workers 2 -b 127.0.0.1:8002 --log-level INFO tracker_worker_api:app`

example:

`http://localhost:8002/`
